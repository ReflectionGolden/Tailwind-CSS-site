        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Example Boxes</h2>
        <p>
            I have used Tailwind CSS to create a div that can be used for containing examples of making use of Tailwind.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these containers, I have set them to have a horizontal margin of 5 using "mx-5" with a vertical margin of 2 using "my-2". I've also done similar with padding using "px-2" and "py-1". The width of the containers is set to fit the content out to a maximum of half of the window by using "w-fit" and "max-w-1/2". I have also given it a slightly lighter background with rounded edges using "bg-neutral-50/5" to make the background a very transparent white colour and "rounded-md" to make the courners rounded for easier viewing. Finally, I've given the container a shadow with a simple "shadow-lg".
        </p>

    <div class="mx-5 my-2 px-2 py-1 w-fit max-w-9/10 lg:max-w-1/2 rounded-md bg-neutral-50/5 shadow-lg border border-emerald-500">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Container Border</h2>
        <p>
            For this specific container, I have also added a border using the colour of emerald-500. It is possible to set borders of various widths in a number of ways, you can use any of the colours available to Tailwind (and any you provide via changing the config) for borders, and it is possible to use different styles such as dashed, dotted, and double along with the default solid border.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mx-5 my-2 px-2 py-1 w-fit max-w-9/10 lg:max-w-1/2 rounded-md bg-neutral-50/5 shadow-lg">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-sky-500 md:text-emerald-500 lg:text-lime-500 xl:text-amber-500 2xl:text-red-500">Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
            I have made alterations to the Tailwind classes for the containers to introduce responsiveness. The first change I've made is having the maximum width be 9/10 of the viewport except for if the screen is of size "md" or larger (which is defined as larger than 768px wide). This first change makes it easier to read the contents of the containers on smaller screens than if they used the same maximum width for all sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another change to help visualise responsiveness is that the colour of this container's title changes based on which screen zise it is being viewed with. Below "sm" (640px) the colour is the same near-white as the rest of the text, from "sm" to "md" the text colour of this container's title is changed to "sky-500", from "md" to "lg" (1024px) the colour is "emerald-500", from "lg" to "xl" (1280px) the colour is "lime-500", from "xl" to "2xl" (1536px) the colour is "amber-500", and finally from 2xl and up the colour is set to "red-500". This is useful for visualising the different screen sizes by resizing the window you are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final change for responsiveness is that on any screen smaller than 2xl the title of the page is given the 3xl size but if the screen is bigger than 2xl it is reduced to a size of xl.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Flex Layout</h2>
        <div class="mx-5 my-2 px-2 py-1 rounded-md bg-neutral-50/5 shadow-lg flex-1">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Flexular One</h2>
            <p>
                The example boxes within this section on the Flex layout are set to "flex-1" in order to both balance out in terms of their size and spacing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It is possible to change the number in "flex-1" to change the element's relative size, as "flex-2" sets the element to be twice the size of an element with "flex-1"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mx-5 my-2 px-2 py-1 rounded-md bg-neutral-50/5 shadow-lg flex-1">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Flexular Two</h2>
            <p>
                This causes both of them to be next to each other, stretching from one side of the page to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                there is also "flex-initial" which causes it to stay at the smallest size it can, plus "flex-auto" which fills any remaining space.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-aqua">Config Customisation</h2>
        <p>
            It is possible to customise the tailwind configuration to do things like include a wider range of colours, such that if you are given a design that needs specific hex values for colours you can add them for use with the different utility classes. This example box has its title given the colour #00FFFF which I have named aqua.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also possible to add or change many other things such as add new font families, change the sizes related to responsiveness to other ones away from the standard, and more.
